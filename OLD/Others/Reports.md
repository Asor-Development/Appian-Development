## Creating
1. Determine the report rquirements for the application
    - ask stakeholders what they want to know
    - look at the performace metric that help define success
2. Determine whether your current data structure and record relationships can produce that information
    - you may need to calculat some fields
    - you can plan out custom record fields that will allow you to use a predefined template or free-form expressions to easily define how your record data is calculated, simplified, or transformed
