# Automation
**Optimizing workflows to reduce errors, increase revenue, add value, and drive up customer satisfaction**
**Workflow capabilites are extended to combine people, technologies and data, to maximize resources and improve business results**

- automation describes the shift of tasks from humans to technology appliations that excel at performing repetitive, time consuming work
- each resource dedicate time and energy to the most appropiate types of work
- technology cannot replace judgment and experience of people(Cognitive)
- people need to monitor the effectiveness of a system's actions and decisions, and take corrective action when needed
- automation can be a combination of AI, RPA and cognitive, human work

## Appian's Automation Suite
- Appian's Automation Suite consist of:
  - Business Rules
  - Smart Services
  - Robotic Process Automation
  - Artificial Intelligence using AI Skills
- Many automation use cases can be solved simply by using Business Rules and process models
- Depending on the solution needed you can combine different components of the Appian Automate Suite
### Business Rules
- assign tasks, execute processes dynamically, set permissions etc....
- complex business specific logic can be captured using the Decision Object
### Integrations
  - should be used for any system that has APIs
  - you can leverage integrations and smart services to help automate your workflows

### Smart Services
- automate common business activities
- drag and drop components that dont require dedicated hardware

### Robotic Process Automation: RPA**
- should be used for legacy systems that dont have APIs
  - can acess data using a user interface, just like a person would(can mimick user interaction)
- assigns repetitive, time-intensive business processes to robots, freeing up people to focus on critical, complex work
- can automate task involving web, desktop and remotely deployed applications
- task recorder intuitively and efficiently create a robotic task as you interact with a web browser
- can be added to any business process

### Artificial Intelligence using AI Skills
- when workflows work with a large volume of documents and emails 
- rich set of artificial intelligence and machine learning(ML) features that can automate workflows
- extract data from documents, classify documents and classify emails
- AI Skills can be added to a process to automate classification and extraction
  - tehn seamlessly loop in people through process automation to reconcile issues and continue the business process
- **Document Extraction AI Skill**
  - extracts text from documents so the data can be used in your applications
- **Document Classification AI Skill**
  - takes documents as inputs and trains an ML model using the data
  - it can then analyzes documnets and classify them by type
- **Email Classification AI Skill**
  - takes emails as inputs trains an ML model using the data
  - it can then analyzes documnets and classify them by type

## Automation Solutions
- identify a process that needs and is appropiate for automation
- identify measurable goals that should be achieved through automation
  - start small but make plans to scale
  - the initial automation efforts results should be measurable, to verify they meet your expectationsand goals before expanding the scale and scope of the intial automation
- automations that affect business operations will likely affect some employees roles and responsibilities
  - change management plan should include process participants buy in and acceptance
- [Automation Use Cases](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/23.3/Automation_Use_Cases.html#when-to-use-automation)
- Does Task Need Automation
  - Assess Automation need
  - Assess Cognitive Automation need(judgment and experience of people)
  - Assess System APIs(System Automation(Appian RPA/API Integration)/The Order Taker
- require Appian to be able to communicate with a targeted system
  - Ex. to retrieve data from another system, Appian can either call an API to access the other system's database or send a robot to act like a human interacting (clicking, typing, etc.) with the other system's UI
- determine the optimal choice for maximizing return on investment (ROI), factors such as:
  - application stability, development complexity, and feasibility play a crucial role
  - the key is to investigate early, and creatively and critically think about the best solution
- For system automation to be reliable, it needs to automate predictable and "routine" or "swivel chair" tasks that do not require cognitive effort or problem-solving (e.g. repetitive data entry). Otherwise, tasks exceeding the capabilities of system automation should be assigned to humans or AI.

### Process Mining
- technology that reads activity logs to discover patterns of behavior inside an organization
- allow you to discover business processes to potimize and automate
- use Appian process Mining to help analyze your processes and provide insight into where automation would be most effective
- you can combine process mining with workflow and automation, and use the insights and act on them faster
