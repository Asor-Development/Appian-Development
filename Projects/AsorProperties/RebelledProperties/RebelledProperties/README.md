2. Multi-Family Home

3. Apartment
    - Rented residential units within a building or a separate dwelling in a home. They are one of the most common types of houses in the USA.
4. Condo/Condominium
- An owner-occupied apartment within a building of individual units. Residents own their condos outright and share ownership of common areas.
5. Co-op/Cooperative
    - Housing corporation where residents own a share that allows them to live in a unit under a proprietary lease agreement. Co-ops are often more affordable than condos but have higher maintenance fees and stricter rules.
6. Duplex
    - A single structure with two private living spaces that share a wall. It can be sold to two separate owners, making it a popular investment property option.
7. Twin Home

10. Row House
    - A group of nearly identical low-rise homes lined up along a city street, sharing common walls and a roofline. They are an iconic part of urban neighborhoods in many American cities.
11. Modular Home

Modular homes, also called prefab or prefabricated homes, are built in a factory in several pieces and assembled on-site. They must follow local building codes and resemble traditional stick-frame homes.
12. Mobile Home

Mobile homes, also called trailers or manufactured homes, are prefabricated homes built on a steel frame and transported to their final location. They are more affordable than traditional homes but may have certain zoning and financing limitations.
13. Tiny Home

A tiny home is a small, compact living space that usually ranges from 100 to 400 square feet. This type of home is growing in popularity due to their affordability, eco-friendliness, and minimalist lifestyle.
