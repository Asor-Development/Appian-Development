# Data Design and structure

1. Outline Data Structures
    - data structures should not be finalized until reporting requirements are finalized, because report content design can impact the data structure
2. Identify Data Sources
3. Verify access to data
    - locate all the data sources and verify or request access, do this before you start creating the application
