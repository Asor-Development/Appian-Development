# Starting a process from outside Appian

**There are three different ways to initiate Appian processes from other systems:**

1. Using a Web API to call the Start Process smart service or initiate a process from Appian RPA.
2. Starting a process by sending an email
3. Exposing your process model as a webservice
When to use each of these methods is outlined in the [Choosing the Right Type of Integration page](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/23.3/Choosing_the_Right_Type_of_Integration.html)
