# Record Views
- consists of an interface that displays information from a single record to end users
- you can create multiple record views to display different combinations of data for each record, targeting the interests and needs of different user groups

### The Summary View

- it is an interface that you create to show a single recordâ€™s data
- may have some of the same data components as the record list
- can also add other record data in the summary view
- Typically, a user sees the Summary view after clicking a record in the record list
- Users can navigate to this view from a column in a grid-style record list, or from the main text in a feed-style record list
- Every record list needs a summary view because it allows users to drill into the individual records.
