- To come up with a list of processes review the applications purpose, goals and key activities perform by the groups that will be using the application

1. Create a planning document
    - should include a list of the processes that need to be created
2. Answer questions about each process identified
    - this is where you would come up with the design for each process
    - do not skip this step design now and configure later
    - What needs to be accomplished by each process
    - Break down the process into a series of sequenced activities or steps
    - you can draw workflow diagrams using any tool
    - as you diagram the process look for opportunities to save time, reduce errors and tighten a process, and elminating unessasary back and forth steps
    - determine the data needed to complete the process and how it will flow
    - identify who is responsible for completing each steps in the process
