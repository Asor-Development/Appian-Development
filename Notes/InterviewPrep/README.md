**Questions to think about as you review your resume**
- Any difficult scenarios or pain points while at your previous employment
    - did you do anything to improve or address them
- Specific ways were you a good teammate or mentor
    - When coworkers would ask about certain concepts or featurs that they were not sure how to implement, I was often the person they asked for help on trying to figure out how to implement them or they asked me to help them find documentation or disscussion on that particular topic
- Any bad decisions in your work in the past that manifested themselves later, and what did you learn from them? 
    - when I first started working as an Appian developer, I would completed requierments by putting different objects together to acheive the business requierment, 
    - and a few times when the requirements changed I would have to go back and change some of the configurations
    - and It was taking me a lot longer to reconfigure objects because I did not have detailed reference of these objects for my own reference 
    - I had a record of what the purpose of each object was but no a detailed explanation of how they were used with other objects and that made it a lot harder to go back and reconfigure things
    - This made me realize that I needed to create a reference of each object for my own documentation and not just the documentation required by the contractor
- In what ways did you push your team and product to be even better
    - Sometimes when we had different developers working on different objects of an application
    - When these object would be put together, the functionality was there but the design or layouts would not look very good together
    - So I would suggest that we agree on a layout before we begun building out the functionality
