## Robotic Process Automation(RPA)
- allows you to automate repetitive and rule manual tasks(coping and pasting, searching)
- can be used to connect to systems that do not have acces to modern APIs
- robotic processes can be created using a point and click interface that enables you to easliy record. monitor and troubleshoot interactions
- once a RPA is built it can be added to an Appian process using a pre-configured smart service
