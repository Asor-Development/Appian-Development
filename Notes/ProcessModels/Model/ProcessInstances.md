# Process Instances
**The process model is the definition of the process, but not the process itself. When a process is launched an instance of that model is created**
- you can see all active instances of a process from the [Monitor view](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/23.3/monitoring_view.html)
- you can open a particular instance and see details about the workflow
- for higher-level information, you have [advanced reporting options](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/23.3/Process_and_Report_Data.html), which can include process data, usage, performance, and tasks metrics, so you can learn how to optimize your processes and applications over time
