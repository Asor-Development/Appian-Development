# Start Process Smart Service
- initiates processes in your process models, interfaces, and web APIs
- processes run asynchronously, meaning that the current process flow will continue without waiting for these processes to complete

## Node
- behavior of the node depends on the permissions of the user running the smart service




## `a!startProcess`
- this is the Start Process smart service as an expression function
- can be executed only inside a saveInto on a Interface Component or as part of a Web API
