# Interface Design


1. Standardizing cards in Selection UIs
    - **Cards Choices component:** creates a group of cards uniform in height and are grouped into rows that make the best use of screen space
        - as you add data cards are automatically organized into rows for the best fit
        - you can choose your card styling preference by selecting one of the templates(Tiles, Bars, Bars-Text Stacked)
    
    - Card Layout: decorative bars are now a standard configuration
        - choose a predefined or custom color and specify a location for displaying the bar

2. Whitespace between screen components
    - you can adjust the white space above and below a component using Margin Above and Margin Below

3. Interface Patterns
    - Tabs consisting of card layouts
    - Lightweight navigation
