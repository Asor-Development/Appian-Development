# Variables
- used to pass in data that is specific to a process or form and may change in different senarios(dynamic)
- used variables when the data will change, if the data will always be the same use a constant
- variables can be
    - Primitive Type(text, integr etc...)
    - Object Type(user, documnet etc...)
    - Custom Date Type
- use rule inputs to define variables
- camel casting is recommended for all variables `firstVariable`
- you can handle null variable values by giving them a value such as a place  holder
    - use the `isnull()` function to test if a value is null or not, returns true if value is null
    - `isnullorempty()` checks for null values, or empty list
## Local 
- locally stored/cached data
- can only be accessed within the function that defines them
- used to reference the same dat mutiple times within an expression
- defined within the `a!localvariable()` function
    - the first parameters are reserved for the name and value of the variables
    - the last parameter is reserved for the evaluation of the variables
- can be used in the definition of other local variables defined after it
- when querying data you might want to query the database once the store it in a local variable and reference that variable when needed, if not then you would be querying the data every time you need it(performace)
