what is CDT?

Its one of the data objects.

As opposed to a primitive or system data type, a custom data type (CDT) is a developer-defined data structure. Data Types allow designers to create a logical grouping of related data that can then be used by other objects to share data. Data can be shared internally, for instance between an interface and process model, or a web service that uses a CDT.

Because a data type will always be used in context of another object, it does not have individual security settings.
